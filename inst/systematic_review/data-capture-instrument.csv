13	Community resilience and health: The role of bonding, bridging, and linking aspects of social capital	Wouter, Poortinga	2012	2007 & 2009 Citizenship Survey, n = 17,572	Multilevel modelling	Neighbourhood deprivation (IMD 2004); SR general health	Bonding social capital; bridging social capital; linking social capital	Survey not designed with social capital in mind; causal claims cannot be made; OA might not represent a ‘neighbourhood’; social capital measured at individual level but might be area-based effect	Social capital might not protect against the effects of neighbourhood deprivation: risk of ‘relying too much on tight neighbourhood networks’
16	'On the street where you live': Neighbourhood deprivation and quality of life among community-dwelling older people in Edinburgh, Scotland	Mottus, Rene; Gale, Catharine R; Starr, John M; Deary, Ian J	2012	Older people (68-71); n = 1091; Edinburgh; Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 follow-up sample (Scottish Mental Survey 1947); lived independently in community; Scottish IMD	Secondary data analysis plus primary contemporary data collection. Bivariate/multivariate correlations	Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF): 4 domains of life quality: physical; psychological; social; environment	Cognitive ability (age 11 & 70) – Moray House Test no 12; other covariates	Possible overlap between IMD measures and questions in QOL (colinear?); more detailed information about neighbourhood environment (e.g. mobility) desirable; cannot generalise beyond this age and cohort.	Neighbourhood deprivation associated with physical and environmental QOL, in spite of confounders. Higher physical and environmental QOL associated with lower neighbourhood deprivation; higher cognitive functioning; education; social class; higher counts of disease. Higher psychological QOL associated with higher social class; current cognitive functioning; lower number of diseases
23	Exploring Health Priorities for Young People Leaving Care	Matthews, Susan; Sykes, Susie	2012	Care leavers/looked after children (LAC); n = 9; 16-21 years; some transitioning out of care; structural disadvantage	Semi-structured interviews; interpretive phenomenological approach (description of experiences/motivations); purposive sampling	Psychological functioning (motivation; self-esteem); absence of risk behaviours (smoking)	Have someone to support, push, or encourage them; resilience ‘training’ before leaving care	Small sample (9); rural Las; not generalisable; English speakers only; recruitment issues; risk of self-selection; no comparison group	View of own health: often medical model; take health for granted; health behaviours often poor because of lack of awareness in care system
32	Defying the odds?: identifying and understanding the relationship between health and resilience	Cairns, Joanne-Marie	2013	LADs; CASWARDs; LSOAs; 2001 census; long term economic deprivation (Townsend)	Mixed methods: regression tree classification; focus groups and in-depth interviews; checked with factor analysis; multiple correspondence analysis; logistic regression	Low premature mortality; low morbidity (SR general health; Limiting long term illness)	Place attachment; social capital; natural environment (benefit of being near nature; symbolic/history for residents)	Difficult to differentiate statistically between different forms of social capital; green space measure of quantity not quality; qual aspects not generalisable and no comparison areas; 	Health resilience dependent on measures and geographical scales used; social capital can be protective and source of risk; shared history/heritage of area can be protective; depends on good quality public services (transport; supermarkets; healthcare; leisure)
37	Work-related needs and experiences of people recovering from mental health problems	Cameron, Josh	2013	Employed people using acute mental health services; community job retention project for MH	Semi-structured interviews	Mental health	(Return to) working; finance; social capital; occupational capital (capacities and skills developed and used in employment); personal capital; feeling competent	Not representative/generalisable; not geographically representative; no ethnic diversity; few physical disability respondents; no respondents aged 30-50	Support returning to work: keep in touch with work; mitigate iatrongenic effects of sick leave; maintain work orientation and identity; return to work planning; peer support
46	Defying the odds: A mixed-methods study of health resilience in deprived areas of England	Cairns-Nagi, Joanne Marie; Bambra, Clare	2013	LADs; CASWARDs; LSOAs; 2001 census; long term economic deprivation (Townsend); case study area NE England	Mixed: RTC; focus groups; in-depth interviews	Premature mortality; self-reported general health; limiting long term illness	Place attachment; social capital; natural environment	Not generalisable; similar areas may not exhibit resilience	Scale in health geography important; used multiple health indicators and highlighted protective factors
67	Sports participation and health during periods of educational transition: a study of 30-35-year-olds in north-west England	Haycock, David; Smith, Andy	2014	30-35 years; NW England; 19 participants	Semi-structured interviews	Sports participation in adult life	Playing/involved in sports in youth; friendship networks; higher social class	Limited aged range; no ethnic diversity; tendency to over self-report positive lifestyle behaviours; low response rate from initial postal survey	Males: typically higher sports participation in secondary school. Lower participation: body image, peer group ‘health inhibiting’ activities; social activities (music; alcohol). FE: dropped sports or sports participation also involved alcohol. HE: returned to sports especially social class C+
78	Coping in Parents and Caregivers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD): a Review	Lai, Wei Wei; Oei, Tian Po	2014	Parents of children with ASD; papers 1970-2013; 6 databases; 9 key terms searched; 37 papers	Systematic review	Coping: lower depression; anxiety; anger; negative mood. Self-rated depression; anxiety inventory; Questionnaire on resources and stress (QRS); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Rosenbery self-esteem scale; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21); Profile of Mood States; multiple bespoke measures	Problem focused: seeking treatment, intervention, information, or social support; reappraisal; reframing; seeking respite. Emotion focused:  adjusting and accommodating. Ways of Coping (WOC) scale; Multidimensional coping inventory (MCI); Brief Social Support Questionnaire; Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced (COPE) inventory; Social Support Index; multiple bespoke measures	Mostly cross-sectional designs; data collection instruments critical: can limit responses if theory-constructed; poorer response from parents if open ended; limited evidence about effectiveness of approaches; sampling bias	Problem focused coping resulted in improved outcomes for parents of ASD children
90	Variations in the relation between education and cause-specific mortality in 19 European populations: A test of the 'fundamental causes' theory of social inequalities in health	Mackenbach, Johan P; Kulhanova, Ivana; Bopp, Matthias; Deboosere, Patrick; Eikemo, Terje A; Hoffmann, Rasmus; Kulik, Margarete C; Leinsalu, Mall; Martikainen, Pekka; Menvielle, Gwenn; Regidor, Enrique; Wojtyniak, Bogdan; Ostergren, Olof; Lundberg, Olle	2015	19 European countries; various mostly national data sources; ages 30-79; 	Calculated relative risks using Poisson regression analysis	Mortality; 24 causes of death; preventable and non-preventable	Behaviour change; medical intervention; injury prevention.	Broad international scope limits data comparability; some countries data was cross-sectional; some countries largely urban samples; accuracy of cause of death certificates not perfect; 	Strong relationship between low education and higher mortality risks BUT mortality relative risks vary by region with similar levels of education; preventable mortality-especially behavioural-has highest variation; limited support for ‘spirit level’ hypothesis that link between SEP and mortality strongest in countries with highest inequalities
96	Risk and resilience: health inequalities, working conditions and sickness benefit arrangements: an analysis of the 2010 European Working Conditions survey	Wel, Kjetil A; Bambra, Clare; Dragano, Nico; Eikemo, Terje A; Lunau, Thorsten	2015	European Working Conditions survey 2010; n = 20k; 28 countries; especially respondents in poor working conditions (demand/control model); 25-60 years	Linear and logistic multilevel regression analyses	Self-reported mental wellbeing WHO wellbeing index; self-reported general health	Level of sickness benefit provision	Sickness benefit provision serves as proxy for wider state social support context; non-response not random; issues of self-reporting; 	Mental wellbeing of employees-especially those exposed to psychosocial job strain and physical hazards or who had little education-better in countries with more generous sickness benefit. No evidence of compensatory model of resilience (ie not health gains for everyone)
98	Peer support as a resilience building practice with men	Robinson, Mark; Raine, Gary; Robertson, Steve; Steen, Mary; Day, Rhiannon	2015	Unemployed men, aged 45-60. 19 stakeholder interviews; 21 respondent interviews	Mixed methods: baseline and follow-up survey; qualitative interviews	Combined overall perceived resilience score (adding together total well-being; self-efficacy; and social support)	"
Peer support"	Focus on 3 aspects of support; post-programme contact or follow-up with participants not realistic. Not discussed: generalisability/representativeness of sampling method; nature of survey instrument	Some men find support offerings feminine and emasculating. Social and peer support should be gender-sensitive in these cases. Peer support-rather than (or alongside) professional support-more effective for these men.
173	A longitudinal investigation of repressive coping and ageing	Erskine, J; Kvavilashvili, L; Myers, L; Leggett, S; Davies, S; Hiskey, S; Hogg, J; Yeo, S; Georgiou, G	2016	Study 1: older and younger adults; n = 66; 33 older (recruited through charities); 33 younger (university students); M/F split;  study 2: older adults and re-test +7 years	Study 1: Questionnaire: measures of repressive coping; mental health; wellbeing; mental control. Anova. Study 2: longitudinal; comparison of repressive coping prevalence in older people at base and +7 years	Wellbeing (GHQ); Thought Control Questionnaire (TCQ) (distraction; worry; punishment; reappraisal; social means of control)	Repressive coping (automatic avoidance of negative or threatening information) – Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) anxiety scale; Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC) (defensive tendency); <= lower quartile for STAI; >= MC scale. Additional measures study 2	Small sample sizes; higher than average income respondents; could not control for education level; income; partnership status	Repressive coping associated with improved mental wellbeing for many respondents (lower unhappiness; lower neuroticism; lower social methods of thought control). More repressive copers in older cohort than younger. Increase in prevalence of repressive copers from t to t+7
195	Access to healthcare for long-term conditions in women involved in street-based prostitution: a qualitative study	Mastrocola, EL; Taylor, AK; Chew-Graham, C	2015	Sex workers accessing 3-sector org (MASH) in Manchester; n = 16; all F; 18+; had chronic condition; street-based sex workers (SBP)	Semi-structured interviews; inductive analysis	Management of chronic conditions (depression; anxiety; psychosis; stress; paranoia; bipolar disorder; physical conditions)	Access to health care (primary in particular)	Respondents recruited through MASH no may not have been most vulnerable; one org; one city; limited ethnic diversity.	Sex workers – high risk status but ability to access treatment limited. Difficult to register with GP practice; often easier to present at A&E. Paper not about resilience particularly, but concerned with improved access to health care for high risk sex-workers
204	This divided land: An examination of regional inequalities in exposure to brownfield land and the association with morbidity and mortality in England	Bambra, C; Cairns, JM; Kasim, A; Smith, J; Robertson, S; Copeland, A; Johnson, K	2015	CASWARDs with brownfield (Previously Developed Land) sites. Census.	GIS: proportion of PDL for each ward. Multilevel models.	SR general health (census); limiting long-term illness or disability (census); all-cause premature mortality (<75) ONS	Distance from brownfield site (greater distance; greater resilience). Brownfield: five categories of Previously Developed Land (PDL). Environmental deprivation MED-Ix (air pollution; temp; UV radiation; proximity to industry; access to green space). Deprivation: Townsend	Cross-sectional: people with poor health might move to areas with higher PDL because cheaper vs people near PDL develop poor health; population density of wards not taking into account; prone to ecological fallacy; definition of PDL broad and covers lots of land use types (not able to differentiate between different types); not all PDL covered in data set (72%); 0 in data set could mean no PDL or missing data; data from different time points (2001; 2002-3; 1998-9; 2009)	Wards with high proportion of PDL had higher premature mortality in regions outside London (London: lower mortality in areas with higher PDL; may be because PDL in London is qualitatively different to other regions eg not de-industrialised land). Smaller effect with SR general health. LLTI higher in high PDL regions.
206	Resilience of health-care workers in the UK; a cross-sectional survey	Sull, A; Harland, N; Moore, A	2015	NHS Trust employees northern England; n = 845; 21% male (in line with 23% male workforce)	Cross-sectional online survey (Survey Monkey); descriptive statistics; bivariate comparison/t-tests; chi-squared tests	Resilience scale was outcome tested.	Resilience Scale (RS-25): I feel I can handle many things at a time; I usually look at a situation in a number of ways	Only 1 NHS Trust; limited demographic measures; health and wellbeing measured by work absence; cross-sectional	Moderate resilience (score of 130 on RS-25); females higher; resilience score increases with age (but not length of service); p/t staff lower resilience score; job band not related. Resilience is conceptualised as process/functioning not good health outcome despite adversity
208	A Systematic Review on Health Resilience to Economic Crises	Glonti, K; Gordeev, VS; Goryakin, Y; Reeves, A; Stuckler, D; McKee, M; Roberts, B	2015	Various: 10 countries. Extracted results of UK papers (3). Periods of economic recession. Only UK/England (n = 3) results reported here.	Systematic review; 6 databases; n = 22 (3 UK); quantitative; longitudinal; exposure: economic crisis; changes in health over time; statistical tests of association; assessed quality of studies with standard tool	General: physical health; mortality; suicide; mental health; health behaviours. UK: physical health; general mental health; sleep quality	Gender and sleep quality; gender and mental health (GHQ-12). Age and mental health (no link); age and sleep loss. Education and mental health. Employment/occupation and physical health; Employment/occupation and mental health; employment and depression and mental illness; employment and sleep disturbance. Income and mental health. Health status and mental health. Area of residence and mental health.	This review: English language papers; no grey literature (although non found); narrative analysis (meta-analysis not possible because of variety of measures); economic depression does not mean all people affected; countries not in economic depression still have people in poverty. Searched papers: Limits to measures - not possible to test if those affected experienced greatest shocks or had least resilience; all studies only compared 2 of pre- during- or post- crisis; limited variety of analytical methods (multilevel model would be beneficial); few studies were comprehensive in their range of factors; lack of reference to theoretical frameworks.	Females: slightly higher prevalence of poor sleep; higher poor mental health. Age: no link with age and mental health; sleep loss declined with increasing age. Education: no evidence of link. Employment: poor SR general health higher among unemployed; mental health less clear – 1 study depression and poor mental health more likley; study 2 no association between employment status and mental health. : financial problems associated with sleep disturbance in 1 study; income not associated with prevalence of poor general mental health in 2. Health status main predictor of sleep loss. Area of residence did not predict general mental health status
241	The Contribution of Social Networks to the Health and Self-Management of Patients with Long-Term Conditions: A Longitudinal Study	Reeves, D; Blickem, C; Vassilev, I; Brooks, H; Kennedy, A; Richardson, G; Rogers, A	2014	Patients with CHD or diabetes; NW England; recruited from GP practice registers; mostly deprived areas; n = 300 from 2000 invitations	Stage 1: postal questionnaire; follow-up qual interview. Stage 2 (12 months later): questionnaire only. Multiple regression.	Health outcomes: self-management; healthy behaviours; physical health; emotional wellbeing; quality adjusted life years (QALYs)	Patient characteristics: age; ethnicity; IMD; occupation class; highest qualification; income. Network members: type of relationships; distance; amount of contact; form of contact. Social network characteristics: amount of different relationship types; network density; support given to others; social resource measure; extent of wider social involvement. Network change: binary yes/no; work lost in the network.	Low response rate; not representative; mostly deprived sample; chronic conditions; NW England; exploratory rather than confirmatory study	Association between individual’s social networks and positive health outcomes. Social involvement with wider resouces (eg community groups) supports self-management and physical and mental health. Help given to others helps with better self-management and physical health. Greater social involvement associated with higher QALYs.
242	The effects of socioeconomic incongruity in the neighbourhood on social support, self-esteem and mental health in England	Albor, C; Uphoff, EP; Stafford, M; Ballas, D; Wilkinson, RG; Pickett, KE	2014	White mothers of children in Millenium Cohort Study. 2000-1; 2004-5; 2006. N = 4,871. England.	Stratified multilevel logistic regression	Depression and anxiety (self-reported diagnosis); Neighbourhood friendship; Self-esteem (abridged Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale)	Difference/similarity between personal status and area status: low status in low status area; low status in high status area	Static measurement of neighbourhood status. Subset of full sample used. Measures used might not be sensitive enough. Potential for regional confounding. No account for urban/rural.	No difference in outcomes between low status mothers in low status or high status areas, suggesting similarity with neighbourhood doesn't improve outcomes/contribute to resilience. High status mothers better outcomes (more neighbourhood friendships; lower risk of poor mental health) in high status areas (but may be material advantage).
250	National household survey of adverse childhood experiences and their relationship with resilience to health-harming behaviors in England	Bellis, MA; Hughes, K; Leckenby, N; Perkins, C; Lowey, H	2014	England; nationally representative survey; adults; face-to-face or paper interview; random stratified probability sample (strat. By region and deprivation(IMD)); n = 4010 (60% response rate)	Statistical analysis: bivariate chi-squared tests; binary logistic regression	No Health Harming Behaviours (HHBs): early sexual initation; unintended teenage pregnancy; daily smoking; binge drinking; cannabis use (lifetime); heroin/crack cocaine use (lifetime); voilence perpetration (past 12months); voilence victimisation (past year); incarceration; poor diet; low physical exercise	(Low) number of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs): sexual abuse; physical abuse; verbal abuse; parental separation; exposure to domestic violence; household mental illness; household alcohol abuse; household drug abuse; household incarceration.	Over-representation of females; over-rep age 60-69; under rep age 18-29; cross-sectional; rely on accurate recall; rely on willingness to report ACEs/HHBs; 	After controlling for deprivation one or more ACEs associated with significant increase in HHBs (although strong association with deprivation). Early life trauma may lead to structural or functional changes in the brain that may predispose the child to more HHBs.
272	Exploring the intergenerational persistence of mental health: Evidence from three generations	Johnston, DW; Schurer, S; Shields, MA	2013	1970 Birth Cohort Survey (BCS); E W S NI; 7 follow-up surveys; n = 8194	Linear regression analyses; mental health measures standardised	Mental health: typically depression; anxiety (Malaise Inventory; statistically similar to GHQ); Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-25) – social; emotional; behavioural functioning	(No) exposure to parental or grandparental mental health	Self-reported measures; attrition bias likely	Children’s mental health significantly and strongly associated with parent’s mental health and grandparent’s mental health. Hinder human capital formation. 
307	The impact of the economic recession on well-being and quality of life of older people	Fenge, Lee-Ann; Hean, S; Worswick, L; Wilkinson, C; Fearnley, S; Ersser, S	2012	Older people. South England. `Asset-rich, income-poor' (home owners, not in receipt of means-tested benefits, not required to complete tax return)	Semi-structured interviews; thematic analysis. N = 28. Snowball/purposive sampling. 2010-11	Social isolation; reduced social capital; physical health; mental health	Economic resilience: budgeting and money management skills. Manage well/better on fixed/reducing income.	Not discussed	Economic recession affects leisure participation of this group; may lead to social isolation and reduced social capital; may then lead to physical and mental health deterioration. Some respondents equipped with resilience factors such as money management and budgeting skills
